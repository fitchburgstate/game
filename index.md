The Major in Game Design – the first of its kind in a public institution in the Northeast – seeks to make the methods and tools of game design and development accessible to everyone. We strive to produce strong game creators with robust skill sets, able to work independently or in productive teams to create powerful, thought-provoking games with solid gameplay mechanics, unified aesthetics, and engaging stories.
