A local-multiplayer sabotage driving game. Up to 4 players take turns controlling 1 car, avoiding obstacles and navigating 2 increasingly crazy courses. If the player crashes while driving, they lose a life. If they lose all of their lives, they're eliminated. The last player left driving is the winner!

Every player has randomized powerups, weapons, and distractions that they can use at any point to sabotage the driver, such as dropping objects onto the track, inverting steering, glitching out the screen, and more!

Based on Sabotage Rally from Cool Games Inc. Featured in [PC Gamer](http://www.pcgamer.com/free-games-of-the-week/), [Free Game Planet](https://www.freegameplanet.com/friender-bender-download-game/).
